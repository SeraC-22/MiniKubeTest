This is the initial test for creating and managing Kubernetes resources using minikube on Apple Silicon.

This should only be accessible to me.

This will create a multi tiered web application using Redis and a go application named guestbook.

Requirements:

Redis Master Pod
Redis Replica Pods
Redis Replica Service
Guestbook Pods
Guestbook Service

Additional content will come in form of tweaks that will be leasted below.

THe purpose of this is to be able to quickly build a go webapp from zero to hero with minimal input, including the automation of minikube through scripting.
